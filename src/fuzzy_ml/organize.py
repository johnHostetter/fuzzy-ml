"""
Implements functions and classes responsible for the design of soft computing solutions,
such as the SelfOrganize class. The SelfOrganize class is a regime that facilitates the
design of self-organizing solutions by adding callable function references to a KnowledgeBase
graph as vertices, and using the edges that connect the vertices (i.e., functions) to determine
the flow of data/information from function to function.

The SelfOrganize class is used to provide a convenient interface for the design of self-organizing
neuro-fuzzy systems. The class contains an instance of a Regime, which provides the functionality
to manage the execution of functions in a thread-safe manner. The SelfOrganize class adds the
ability to create a KnowledgeBase graph, which is used to represent the flow of data between
functions in the self-organizing system.
